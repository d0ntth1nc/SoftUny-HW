 * Write a method to convert from radians to degrees.
 * You are given a number n and n queries for conversion.
 * Each conversion query will consist of a number + space + measure.
 * Measures are "deg" and "rad". Convert all radians to
 * degrees and all degrees to radians. Print the results as n lines,
 * each holding a number + space + measure.
 * Format all numbers with 6 digit after the decimal point
