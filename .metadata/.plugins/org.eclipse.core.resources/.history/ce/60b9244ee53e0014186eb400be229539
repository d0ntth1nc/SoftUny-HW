/*
 * We are given a sequence of N playing cards from a standard deck.
 * The input consists of several cards (face + suit),
 * separated by a space.
 * Write a program to calculate and print at
 * the console the frequency of each card face in
 * format "card_face -> frequency".
 * The frequency is calculated by
 * the formula appearances / N and is expressed in
 * percentages with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point.
 * The card faces with their frequency should be
 * printed in the order of
 * the card face's first appearance in the input.
 * The same card can appear multiple times in the input,
 * but it's face should be listed only once in the output.
